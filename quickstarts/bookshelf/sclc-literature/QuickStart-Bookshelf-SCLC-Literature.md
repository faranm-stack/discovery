# Quick Start — Bookshelf: SCLC Treatment Literature Research

> **How this QuickStart runs:** The user opens Discovery, creates a new empty project, selects GPT-6 Astra and sends a setup message with this guide's GitHub link. The user may know nothing about Discovery, Bookshelves or this scenario. If the link is a `github.com/.../blob/...` page, read the raw file. Read this entire guide first, then follow section 5 (setup), section 6 (research question) and the acceptance checks in section 6. In plain language, tell the user what the experiment does, then ask permission before downloading the 15 papers listed under **Required files** into a new `sclc-papers` folder in the open project, and verify each size and SHA-256. **Opening the link and downloading the papers is your job:** if you can't read the `github.com` page, fetch the raw file, or download with a local command (for example PowerShell `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl`). Never ask the user to download files instead. Only if every method fails, tell the user exactly what failed, including the error message. You cannot click the app's buttons; when section 5 needs the user to create the Bookshelf, give them the exact values to type and wait for them to confirm it shows **Successfully indexed**. Reading or downloading this guide is not permission to install or compute.
>
> **Required files:** the 15 open-access papers in section 2, **19,134,519 bytes** in total. Keep each original filename (`PMC<id>.<version>.pdf`). The same list, with titles, DOIs and licence records, is in [`files/manifest.json`](files/manifest.json). All 15 download links were checked anonymously on 2026-11-13 and matched their recorded SHA-256.

**Status: draft, not yet validated.** The setup path and paper set are fixed. The research question in section 6 is **proposed** and needs owner approval, and no reference answer exists yet. The first validated run, reviewed by the owner, becomes the reference. Fields marked **Pending** must be completed before publication.

## 1. Recipe identity — required

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scenario and observable outcome | Build a Bookshelf from 15 open-access small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) papers, then ask a fixed research question. The outcome is a cited answer on current treatment options for extensive-stage SCLC, grounded only in those papers. |
| Audience / vertical | Scientists and evaluators trying Discovery Bookshelf for literature-grounded research; Bookshelf collection |
| Delivery mode | App (local project) |
| Tested configuration / profile identifier | `sclc-literature-v1` (proposed; not yet tested) |
| Owner / recipe version / last validated date | **Pending** owner; version 0.1-draft; not validated |

## 2. Configuration matrix

| Component | Applicability | Configuration to record |
|---|---|---|
| Model | Core | Chat: **GPT-6 Astra** (`gpt-6-astra`). Bookshelf embedding: `text-embedding-3-small (Copilot)`, fixed by the app. Bookshelf answer generation: chosen from the models the app lists for the user's GitHub account, **Pending** (record the exact choice from the first validated run). |
| Agents | Core | The default Discovery assistant. It reads this guide and queries the Bookshelf with the app's built-in tools, which are available in every chat without extra setup. The catalog [bookshelf-researcher](../../../agents/bookshelf-researcher/README.md) agent describes the intended research style (cited, confidence-rated, Bookshelf-only evidence); using it is optional and not yet tested here. |
| Orchestration | Core | Sequential: download and verify papers → user creates the Bookshelf and waits for indexing → assistant asks the fixed question → assistant checks the answer against section 6. No parallel workers. |
| Tools / APIs | Core | Local file download (PowerShell `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl`) and SHA-256 verification. The app's built-in Bookshelf tools: `discovery.bookshelf.listShelves`, `discovery.bookshelf.search` and `discovery.bookshelf.ask`. Call them one at a time; on a busy or worker error, report it rather than retrying automatically. |
| Azure Container Apps (ACA) | N/A | Not used. |
| Sample inputs | Core | 15 PMC open-access PDFs listed below; 19,134,519 bytes total; sources and hashes from [`files/manifest.json`](files/manifest.json) and [`files/selection_sclc.json`](files/selection_sclc.json). |

**Bookshelf — local, tested profile values:**

| Field | Tested profile value |
|---|---|
| Source corpus | 15 documents; 19,134,519 bytes of PDF; corpus `sclc-literature-v1` |
| Index | **Pending** (record indexed size and chunk count shown after indexing) |

| Index-ready condition | The Bookshelf shows **Successfully indexed** with 15 files, and a test question returns citations from these papers |

## 4. Prerequisites

- **Access:** Microsoft Discovery app; GitHub account with a GitHub Copilot subscription; access to GPT-6 Astra.
- **Environment:** Internet access to `pmc-oa-opendata.s3.amazonaws.com` and `raw.githubusercontent.com`. No Python, containers or Azure resources are needed.
- **Authentication:** App sign-in only. No secrets are used.
- **Data:** All 15 papers are PubMed Central open-access articles recorded as **CC BY 4.0**, and none is marked retracted. Keep attribution. The papers are downloaded from their sources, not redistributed in this repository. When the Bookshelf is built and queried, the app sends document chunks and questions to GitHub using the user's Copilot account; this is acceptable here because the papers are public.

## 5. Setup — one reproducible reference path

1. **Select profile:** `sclc-literature-v1`, local App project, GPT-6 Astra.
2. **Install/provision:** App only. Services: N/A.
3. **Download and verify the papers (assistant):** with the user's permission, create a `sclc-papers` folder in the open project and download all 15 files from section 2 into it. Check each file's size and SHA-256. Report a table of all 15 with pass or fail. **Done when:** 15 of 15 pass.
4. **Create the Bookshelf (user, in the app):** the assistant cannot click buttons, so give the user these exact steps and values:
   1. In the left sidebar, click **AI capabilities**, then the **Bookshelves** tab, then **New bookshelf**.
   2. On **1. Details**: **Name** `sclc-literature` (3 to 24 letters, numbers or hyphens); **Description** `Fifteen open-access papers on small-cell lung cancer treatment.` (optional); **Embedding model** is fixed, leave it; **Answer generation** is required: open the list, choose a model, and tell the assistant which one. Click **Next**.
   3. On **2. Files**: click **Upload**. The file window opens in the project folder; open `sclc-papers`, press **Ctrl+A** to select all 15 PDFs, and click **Open**. Check that 15 files are listed and click **Next**.
   4. On **3. Review + create**: check the values and click **Create**.
   5. Wait until the Bookshelf shows **Successfully indexed**, then tell the assistant.
5. **Verify readiness (assistant):** call `discovery.bookshelf.listShelves` and confirm `sclc-literature` is listed (and, if a document count is shown, that it is 15). Then call `discovery.bookshelf.ask` with `shelfNames: ["sclc-literature"]` and a short test question, for example "Which drug is studied in the LURBICLIN study?", and confirm the answer cites a paper from this set. **Done when:** the shelf is listed and the test answer is cited. If the Bookshelf tools are missing or fail, stop and report the exact error.

## 6. Fixed prompt + matching output

**Binding:** profile `sclc-literature-v1`; Bookshelf `sclc-literature` built from the 15 papers in section 2; GPT-6 Astra. **The prompt below is proposed and needs owner approval.**

**Exact predefined prompt (proposed)**

```text
Using only the sclc-literature Bookshelf, summarise the current treatment options for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Cover: (1) first-line chemo-immunotherapy and who is eligible; (2) second-line options after platinum-based chemotherapy, including lurbinectedin and topotecan-class agents; (3) DLL3-targeted therapy, including tarlatamab; and (4) what molecular subtypes or biomarkers suggest about who benefits. For every claim, cite the paper it comes from. End with a short table comparing the second-line options and a list of questions these papers cannot answer.
```

**Matching output** — **Pending.** No validated reference answer exists yet. The first run that passes the checks below, reviewed by the owner, becomes the reference answer and is stored with this guide.

| Acceptance | Check |
|---|---|
| Required format / artifacts | A written answer with four labelled parts, a second-line comparison table and a "not covered" list. Every factual claim has a citation to one of the 15 papers. |
| Exact checks | Cites only papers from this set (no outside sources). Mentions each of these treatments, which appear in the paper titles: durvalumab, lurbinectedin, topotecan, belotecan, nab-paclitaxel and tarlatamab. Cites at least one review (R1–R6) and at least one primary study (P1–P9). |
| Approximate / domain checks | **Pending owner:** claims match the cited papers; no invented trial results or numbers; limitations stated where the papers disagree or are small studies. A reviewer spot-checks at least five citations against the PDFs. |
| Pass condition | All exact checks pass and the owner or a named reviewer signs off the domain checks. |

## 7. Expected runtime

No measured runs yet. All values are **Pending**.

| Stage | Measured / Estimated | First response (optional) | Completion duration / range, with units | Conditions / observations / runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| One-time install/provision/setup | Pending | N/A | Pending | Download of 19 MB of papers plus Bookshelf creation |
| One-time data loading/indexing | Pending | N/A | Pending | Local indexing of 15 PDFs |
| Cold-start prompt run | Pending | Pending | Pending | First question after indexing completes |
| Warm prompt run | Pending | Pending | Pending | Repeat question in the same session |

## 8. Troubleshooting, cleanup and extensions

- **A download fails or a checksum doesn't match:** re-download that one file from its link in section 2. Do not substitute another version of the paper.
- **Indexing shows Failed:** delete the Bookshelf and create it again with the same 15 files. Record the error shown.
- **No answer generation models are listed:** the app shows "This GitHub account has no compatible Bookshelf answer generation models." Check the GitHub Copilot sign-in and subscription; the Bookshelf can't be created without one.
- **A Bookshelf question fails with an error:** a transient error has been seen on local Bookshelf questions (model returned HTTP 409, reported as "Failed to ask local bookshelf: 500"); retrying in a new session succeeded. Record the error and retry once.
- **Cleanup:** delete the `sclc-literature` Bookshelf from **AI capabilities → Bookshelves** and delete the `sclc-papers` folder. No cloud resources are created.
- **Optional vertical addendum:** This is literature research, not medical advice. Answers summarise the 15 papers only and may be out of date.

## 9. Publication checklist

- [ ] One reference path reproduced; versions, sample inputs and prompt fixed to the tested profile.
- [ ] Output validated; exact/approximate acceptance criteria and domain checks explicit.
- [ ] Applicable configuration/specs complete; unused fields N/A; compatibility checked; no unverified minima claimed.
- [ ] Timings labeled with conditions; setup/indexing distinct from cold/warm runs.
- [x] No secrets; samples permitted (CC BY 4.0, downloaded from source); cleanup documented. Owner, version and validation date: **Pending**.
